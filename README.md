# Imageflow
> Imageflow is me trying to use the actual tecnologies of AI and ML to create a new way to use images. Here I pretend to use Dall-e to genarate images based on text and also use the GPT-3 to create a new way to use images.

## :construction: Technologies
This project will be developed using the following technologies:
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
- [dall-e](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/)
- [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/)
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)


## About the project
The Imageflow is my new project that I'm trying to create a new way to use images. I'm using the Dall-e to generate images based on text and also using the GPT-3 to create a new way to use images, and of course, I'm using the React and React Native to create the web and mobile app and tryng to use the tensorflow to create a ML model to create my own image generator tecnology.
This project is a personal project and needs a lot of work to be done, but I'm trying to do my best to implement my new knowledge and tecnologies that I'm learning, in special the AI and ML.
Today AI is in the spotlight and I'm trying to use this tecnologies to help in my workflow, all this project will be developed with AI pair programming. 
Stay tuned for more updates.
